  <p>Elephants are the largest living land mammals.
The largest elephant recorded was one shot in Angola, 1974.
It weighed 27,060 pounds (13.5 tons) and stood 13 feet 8 inches tall.
Their skin color is grey.
At birth, an elephant calf may weigh as much as 100 kg (225 pounds).
The baby elephant develops for 20 to 22 months inside its mother.
No other land animal takes this long to develop before being born.
In the wild, elephants have strong family relationship.
Their ways of acting toward other elephants are hard for people to understand.
They "talk" to each other with very low sounds. Most elephants sounds are so low, people cannot hear them.
But elephants can hear these sounds far away.
Elephants have strong, leathery skin to protect themselves.
The average life span of an elephant is 50-70 years, but the oldest known elephant in the world was 86 when he died.</p>

<p>Both African and Asian elephants are endangered species.
African elephants receive some legal protection in every country where they are found.
However, 70% of their range exists outside protected areas.
Conservation efforts in some areas have led to more elephants.
Local numbers may be controlled by contraception or moving the elephants to other places.
Large-scale culling (legal killing) ceased in 1988, when Zimbabwe stopped doing it.
In 1989, trade in elephants and their products (ivory, meat) was made illegal.
Appendix II status (which allows restricted trade) was given to elephants in Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe in 1997 and South Africa in 2000.
In some countries, sport hunting of the animals is legal:
Botswana, Cameroon, Gabon, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe have export quotas for elephant trophies.
The IUCN estimates a total of around 440,000 individuals for 2012.</p>

<p>Elephants have very sensitive skin and use mud as a form of sunscreen.
They need to take regular mud baths in order to protect themselves from sunburn, insect bites and moisture loss.
Elephant feet are covered in a soft padding that helps to support their weight,
as well as preventing them from slipping and dulling the sound of their footsteps.
As a result, elephants can walk almost silently, despite their huge weight.
Furthermore, elephants use their feet to listen to the sub-sonic rumblings made by other elephants through vibrations in the ground.
They have been observed to listen by putting their trunks on the ground and carefully positioning their feet.
Female elephants remain pregnant for 2 years – the longest gestation period of all mammals.
Having a baby elephant is no small commitment either.
You may ask how much does an elephant weigh at birth, and the answer is a staggering 120kg!</p>

<div id="fifth-paragraph">
<p>Elephants are highly sensitive and caring animals, and have been observed to express grief, compassion, altruism and play.
They perform greeting ceremonies when a friend that has been away for some time returns to the group,
and they sometimes ‘hug’ by wrapping their trunks together.
Elephants will pay respect to the bones of their dead by gently touching the skulls and tusks with their trunks and feet.
Elephants are able to recognise themselves using mirrors.
Such displays of self-recognition indicates a very high level of awareness,
and is something which only humans, apes, cetaceans and magpies are otherwise known to do.
They dig waterholes when river beds are dry that other animals can use as a water source,
and their large footprints can create deep holes for water to collect in.</p>

<div id="sixth-paragraph">
<img id="elephant-photo7" src="images/last-elephant.jpg" alt = "Elephants">
<p>Elephants are able to recognise and distinguish human voices.
They can tell the difference between human languages, male and female voices, friendly voices and those associated with danger.
Unlike stories suggest, elephants are not afraid of mice.
They are however, terrified of bees and ants,
so some African farmers protect their fields from elephant damage by lining the borders with beehives.</p>
